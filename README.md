# URL-Shortener

This URL-Shortener app can be accessed via: https://dh-url-shortener.vercel.app

All links that have been shortened before will retain its shortened URL.

This is the back-end of my URL-Shortener app, built with Node.js (Express), hosted on Heroku.

The front-end uses Axios to make get and post requests which communicates with the back-end, built with Node.js (Express), and stores/retrieves saved URLs from MongoDB.
